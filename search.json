    "text": "I am currently writing two (yes, two) textbooks for Oxford University Press:\n\n\n\n“Introduction to Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences - with R”, and\n\n\n“Introduction to Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences - with SPSS”.\n\n\n\nWith the research process at its heart, the book explores how quantitative methods can be used to answer research questions in the social sciences. In a personable and engaging style, the author introduces students to quantitative methods and how to implement them in the software R. With practical, cutting-edge pedagogical features, it turns the often-dreaded word “statistics” into a fun and rewarding experience. Anticipated publication: 2026.\n\n\nFeedback from reviewers to date:\n\n\n\n“One of the best books in quants and RStudio I have read (so far).”\n\n\n“A splendid book by an author whose writing makes you like him and want to stick with it.”\n\n\n“I am really very impressed by the quality and clarity of expression and communication in these chapters. I would be very happy to have this author teach my students!”\n\n\n“It is much more conversational and accessible than the style in Imai, with more examples for each concept.”"
